% Use of R object inline
In the Table \ref{summaryNumeric}, you realize that the mean of military expenditure is {\bf\Sexpr{mean(mergedData$mili_pctGDP)}}.

It would be good to see a boxplot, check Figure \ref{numBoxplot} below.

box = base + geom_boxplot(aes(y=mili_pctGDP)) 
box = box + labs(x="", y = "% of country GDP")
box=box + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
                axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
box

\section{My Regression}\label{regre}

Several times we need regression.

<<regresPrep, echo=FALSE>>=
## prepare regressions
h1=formula(mili_pctGDP~DemocracyIndex)
regre1=lm(h1,data=mergedData)

h2=formula(mili_pctGDP~DemocracyIndex + IndexofEconomicFreedom)
regre2=lm(h2,data=mergedData)
@


This is a nice summary for two regressions:

<<regs1, echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=
## show result of both
stargazer(regre1,regre2,
          title = "Regression Models",
          label = 'regs1')
@

stargazer(regre1,regre2,
          title = "Regression Models",
          dep.var.labels   = "Military Expenditure (percent of GDP)",
          covariate.labels = c("Democracy", "Economic Freedom"),
          label = 'regs2')
@

I hope you like what you see in the Table \ref{regs1} and in Table \ref{regs2}. You can learn more on regression in 
other book \citep[150-160]{petrie_introduction_2016}
